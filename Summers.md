Over the summer I had an internship at Lockheed Martin where I coded missiles & some other stuff. Meanwhile, I also worked on an app on nights and weekends that I plan to put on the appstore by the end of September. Once the internship ended I also finished writing a paper with Dr. Wu about a research project we worked on last year for Lockheed and Cisco.

Over the summer I worked full time for the company I interned for two years ago. I helped to manage and instruct the new interns for this year as well as continued my own work on site development and server maintenance.

Over the last summer, I spent my time completing an online course for CT300. I also spent a lot of time working with my uncle learning how to be proficient with tools and other handy skills. When I wasn't working with my uncle, I was reading and trying to brush up on my Java skills.

This summer I worked two jobs. I worked at Target full time and Aldi part time. As a result I was able to make more moeney this summer than ever before, but I also had very little time for freinds or hobbyies. Although I did go on a fun tree climbing obsticle course with my family for a day.

Over the summer I worked in Muncie at Shipt where I delivered groceries from Meijer and Target to people around Muncie. I had a small hobby of content creation during the summer that didn't really take off but it was a fun thing to do while in quarantine. I also taught myself how to do basic photoshop.
